# Radiant-POS-Recreation (unfinished)
This was a personal project I decided to start in 2018. I have worked as a fuel attendant at Sunoco since 2015. Sunoco uses the Radiant POS system for all of its cash registers. Since I've had to use this system every day that I worked there, I thought it would be cool to try and recreate the system.
