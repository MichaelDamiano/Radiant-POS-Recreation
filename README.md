# Radiant-POS-Recreation (unfinished)
This was a personal project I decided to start in 2018. I have worked as a fuel attendant at Sunoco since 2015. Sunoco uses the Radiant POS system for all of its cash registers. Since I've had to use this system every day that I worked there, I thought it would be cool to try and recreate the system. I intended to use C# as the main language of the system however I had less accessability to C# at the time due to limited resources (My laptop at the time had a very small amount of storage) so I decided to use python as well to lay out the logic of the system.
